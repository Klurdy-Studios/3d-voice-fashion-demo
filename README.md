# Voice-Activated Interfaces for 3D

This is a demonstration of using NLP to create voice-activated experiences for viewing 3D products. It uses NLP to generate product descriptions and intent recognition to create actions from voice. It leverages Web Speech API for text-to-speech. Currently tested only on Chrome.
